Multi-omics analysis of blood plasma and synovial fluid extra-cellular vesicles after induction of OA. The dataset consists of proteomics data and small RNA sequencing. The sequencing data has been [previously published](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.901269/full).

The current analysis consists of:

-   QC and normalisation [here](01_QC_normalisation.html).
-   Exploratory data analysis [here](02_EDA.html).
-   Differential expression analysis [here](03_DE_and_clustering.html).
